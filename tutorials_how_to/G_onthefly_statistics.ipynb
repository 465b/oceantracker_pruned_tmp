    "\n",
    "Scaling up particle numbers to millions will create large volumes of\n",
    "particle track data. Storing and analyzing these tracks is slow and\n",
    "rapidly becomes overwhelming. For example, building a heat map from a\n",

    "tide by designating a range of particle status values to count. Or, only\n",

    "Currently there are two main classes of particle statistics, \"gridded\" and \"polygon\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gridded statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "These are heat maps of counts binned into cells of a regular grid. Along\n",
    "with heat maps of particle counts, users can optionally build a heat\n",
    "maps of named particle properties, eg. the value decaying particle\n",
    "property. To ensure the heat map grids are not too large or too coarse,\n",
    "by default grids are centred on each release group, thus there are\n",
    "different grid locations for each release group.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polygon statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These particle counts can be used to calculate the connectivity between\n",
    "each release group and a user given list of “statistics” polygons. Also,\n",
    "used to estimate the influence of each release group on a particle\n",
    "property with each given statistics polygon. The statistics polygons are\n",
    "not the same as those used in a polygon release (they can be if the user\n",
    "requires it). Polygon statistics show effect of each point or polygon\n",
    "release, on the given statistics polygons. A special case of a polygon\n",
    "statistic, is the “residence_time” class, which can be used to calculate\n",
    "the fraction of particles from each release group remaining within each\n",
    "statistics polygon at each ‘update_interval’ as one way to estimate\n",
    "particle residence time for each release group.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Particle property statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of statistics can also record sums of user designated\n",
    "particle properties within each given grid cell or statistics polygon,\n",
    "which originate from each release group. These sums enabling mean values\n",
    "of designated particle properties within each grid cell or polygon to be\n",
    "calculated. They can also be used to estimate the relative influence of\n",
    "each release group on the value of a particle property within each given\n",
    "grid cell or polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A future version with allow estimating the variance of the designated\n",
    "property values and particle counts in each grid cell or\n",
    "polygon, for each release group.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time verses Age statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both gridded and polygon statistics come in two types, “time” and “age”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*  “time” statistics are time series, or snapshots, of particle numbers\n",
    "and particle properties at a time interval given by  “calculation_interval” parameter. Eg. gridded stats showing how the  heat map of a source’s plume evolves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  “age” statistics are particle counts and properties binned by  particle age. The result are age based histograms of counts or particle proprieties. This is useful to give numbers in each age band arriving at a given grid cell or polygon, from each release group.  Eg. counting how many larvae are old enough to settle in a polygon or    grid cell from each potential source location.\n",
