    "[This note-book is in oceantracker/tutorials_how_to/]\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling up particle numbers to millions will create large volumes of\n",
    "particle track data. Storing and analyzing these tracks is slow and\n",
    "rapidly becomes overwhelming. For example, building a heat map from a\n",
    "terabyte of particle tracks after a run has completed. Ocean tracker can\n",
    "build some particle statistics on the fly, without recording any\n",
    "particle tracks. This results in more manageable data volumes and\n",
    "analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "On-the-fly statistics record particle counts separately for each release group. It is also possible to subset the counts, ie only count particles which are stranded by the\n",
    "tide by designating a range of particle status values to count. Or, only\n",
    "count particles in a given vertical “z” range. Users can add multiple\n",
    "statistics, all calculated in from the same particles during the run.\n",
    "Eg. could add a particle statistic for each status type, for different\n",
    "depth ranges.\n",

    "\n",
    "Currently there are two main classes of 2D particle statistics \"gridded\" which counts particles inside cells of a regular grid, and \"polygon\" which counts particles in a given list of polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can add many particle statistics classes, all based on the same particles. For both types it is possible to only count a subset of these particles, by setting a min. and/or max status to count, or setting a min. and/or max. \"z\", the vertical location. So could  add several statistics classes, each counting particles in different layers, or classes to separately count those moving and those on the bottom hoping to be re-suspended.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gridded statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "These are heat maps of counts binned into cells of a regular grid. Along\n",
    "with heat maps of particle counts, users can optionally build a heat\n",
    "maps of named particle properties, eg. the value decaying particle\n",
    "property. To ensure the heat map grids are not too large or too coarse,\n",
    "by default grids are centred on each release group, thus there are\n",
    "different grid locations for each release group.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polygon statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "These particle counts can be used to calculate the connectivity between\n",
    "each release group and a user given list of “statistics” polygons. Also,\n",
    "used to estimate the influence of each release group on a particle\n",
    "property with each given statistics polygon. The statistics polygons are\n",
    "not the same as those used in a polygon release (they can be if the user\n",
    "requires it). Polygon statistics show effect of each point or polygon\n",
    "release, on the given statistics polygons. A special case of a polygon\n",
    "statistic, is the “residence_time” class, which can be used to calculate\n",
    "the fraction of particles from each release group remaining within each\n",
    "statistics polygon at each ‘update_interval’ as one way to estimate\n",
    "particle residence time for each release group.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Particle property statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of statistics can also record sums of user designated\n",
    "particle properties within each given grid cell or statistics polygon,\n",
    "which originate from each release group. These sums enabling mean values\n",
    "of designated particle properties within each grid cell or polygon to be\n",
    "calculated. They can also be used to estimate the relative influence of\n",
    "each release group on the value of a particle property within each given\n",
    "grid cell or polygon.\n",
